    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>I'm new to web design! I have held <strong>many</strong> jobs in the past, but <em>I hope </em>I'll be able to make a career out of this skill. I'm learning basic HTML right now, as a foundation to build upon. 
    </p>
    <h2>Hold On!</h2>
    <p>
        I've always had trouble sticking with a program before, but so far I've really enjoyed this set of courses. Hopefully that gives me enough staying power to stick through till the end. My mantra right now is that <em>"I am worthy of all the best in life and I can do anything I dream of doing."</em>
